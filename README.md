# RT
RT - Revamped Ray Tracer - First major group project

As a follow up to RTv1 (my first raytracer), RT is a group project in which we vastly expanded our raytracers' capabilities in addition to learning how to collarborate on a project with 4 people through github and other group task managing tools. Here are some additional features we are proud of:

- GTK interface
- GPU multithreading implemented through CUDA
- Handle object transparency, reflectivity with Frensel
- Light travelling through transparent objects have their color modified.
- Linking objects (to move or rotate grouped objects simultaneously)
- Ambient lighting
- Global lighting
- Parallel and Spherical lighting
- Textures (noise, Perlin noise, checkerboard and custom user-added textures)
- Normal mapping
- Antialiasing
- Filters (Sepia, Cartoon, Dalton, and sterioscopy)
- Photon Mapping with caustics
- Save and open .rt files
- Save scenes as bmp files
