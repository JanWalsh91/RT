# Libft
Libft - my first library

This is the first major project at 42 aimed to create essential functions. Many of them are replicas of standard libraries, and many more are other very useful functions. Over the course of my education at 42, I have added more functions based on the needs of programs I have created.

Here are some of my favorite functions:

ft_strsjoinfree: joins many strings together (variadic function) and frees them
ft_wctostr: converts a wide character to a char string.
ft_itoa_base : converts an integer in base 10 to any other base up to base 16 and returns a char string.
ft_strsplit: splits a char string into an array of strings using a custom char delimiter.

Should you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to send me an email at **jwalsh@student.42.fr**.
